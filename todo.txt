* I changed from source
+ I kept source, but it looks like it may be wrong

Notes:
    With macdictate, watch out for homonyms:
        Derrick's vs. Derricks'
        It's vs. Its
        There vs. Their vs. They're

Dedication:
    + Who's Who is not italicized in original.  But it refers to a book.  Should
        it be italicized?

Chapter 1
    + Page 11: "sketching tour in the west."  Shouldn't west be capitalized?
    + Page 11: "...on last time I saw him), with" Shouldn't comma be before )
    + Page 12: "...fullof emotion)." Shouldn't period be before )
    Page 13: modernize "summer time" as "summertime" ? 
    Page 14: GARNET!!!!! is rendered in tiny type--doesn't look right.

Chapter 2
    + Page 15: "Who's Who" should it be italicized?  (not ital in orig.)
    + Page 18: "head master" should it be "headmaster"? ("head master" in orig.)

Chapter 3
    Page 29: skintight or skin-tight (because noun?)
    * Page 29: "either blue nor grey" changed to either blue or grey
    Page 30: in ebook, paragraph after poem starts without indent??

Chapter 4
    + Page 42: manoever ligature
    + Page 43: "gun in his hands stood",
        instead of: gutenberg put a comma after hands

Chapter 5
    Page 47: double-check if comma in first sentence
    + Page 50: marquess,-- comma-em-dash
    + Page 54: manoeuvres, ligature
    + Page 58: sides,--
    + Page 59: places,--
    * Page 60: "onto a good thing" in source
        * I corrected to "on to a good thing"
    Page 60: "on to a good thing Garny, my boy" should be "thing, Garny, my"?
    + Page 60: of July,--a glorious

Chapter 6
    + wrong-headedness - should be one word?

Chapter 7
    "outwardly resigned but inwardly, as I, who knew" not same as source
        - "but inwardly as I, who knew" in source, still awkward
    + unbiassed - should be "unbiased" ?
    + "There was croquet after lunch,--" comma em-dash??

Chapter 8
    * Fixed comma to period at end of:
        "We was talking there, ma'am, when Bob, what had followed me unknown,
        trotted in.
    + chimbley is dialect form of chimney, and chimley is an alternate form of
        chimbley (left it in for Hired Man speech)
    + Put comma em-dash back in:
        I could read what was passing in his mind,<em-dash>
    + using "appal" with one "l" because of British spelling 

Chapter 9
    + Retribution calling at the wrong address,
        comma after address is weird but in source
    + (now moving in society once more, and in his right mind),
        in source material -- parenthesis comma
    Words that show up as misspelled:
        reestablish
        lightheartedness

Chapter 10
    * "Not really a Coward" - not capitalized in source but I capitalized it
    * "Net and Mackerel" was quoted in source, but not quoting here

Chapter 11
    * decided against such a course - source has "source" but this makes no
        sense, so I'm keeping it corrected as gutenberg had it
    + "Why, yes, Mr. Ukridge, I think I will." starts a new paragraph in source
        but gutenberg keeps it in the previous para because same speaker
        I put it back to source to show the same speaker has spoken a new
        paragraph
    * "Why do I miss these goods things?" in source corrected to "good things?"

Chapter 12
    + comma-mdash after "at least Ukridge and Beale had,--"
    * revamped quotes and mdashes on "I have just got <i>The Outsider</i>"

Chapter 13
    + comma-mdash "crushed,--a mere human jelly"
    + mdash-period "a tide in the affairs of men, which, taken by the flood--."
    + comma-mdash "I served again,--a beauty."
    
Chapter 14
    * changed "desolute" to "desolate" because I can't find the word
        "desolute"
    + comma-mdash "I think dear,--yes, it was Harrod's"
    + comma-mdash "dunning one in one's own garden,--well, it's a little hard,"
 
Chapter 15
    + comma-mdash "morning was perfect,--the most glorious of a glorious"
    + comma-mdash "Dear Sir,--My Harry, Mr. Hawk, sas to me"

Chapter 16
    * "I punched Tom Leigh" doesn't start new paragraph in source, but
        I changed it because it starts new double-quote and seems to need to.
    * hard to tell but I believe "and Harrod's jumpy, or that the bearings"
        actually does have a comma in the source
    
Chapter 17

Chapter 18
    + Ukridge says "damme", other times in text it is "damn" ??

Chapter 19

Chapter 20
    * not be drear and blank; that a more judicious
        is colon in source, but doesn't make sense so I changed it to semicolon
    * "Me dear boy,--" in source mdash is outside of quotes, but I 
        corrected it.
