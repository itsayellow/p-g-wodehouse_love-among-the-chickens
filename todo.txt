I CHANGED FROM SOURCE
---------------------

Dedication:

Chapter 1

Chapter 2

Chapter 3
    * Page 26: "golf-clubs" changed to "golf clubs"
    * Page 27: "golf-bag" changed to "golf bag"
    * Page 29: "either blue nor grey" changed to either blue or grey

Chapter 4

Chapter 5
    * Page 60: "onto a good thing" in source
        * I corrected to "on to a good thing"

Chapter 6

Chapter 7
    * Page 73 "unbiassed" - changed to "unbiased"
    "outwardly resigned but inwardly, as I, who knew" not same as source
        - "but inwardly as I, who knew" in source, still awkward

Chapter 8
    * Fixed comma to period at end of:
        "We was talking there, ma'am, when Bob, what had followed me unknown,
        trotted in.

Chapter 9

Chapter 10
    * "Not really a Coward" - not capitalized in source but I capitalized it
    * "Net and Mackerel" was quoted in source, but not quoting here

Chapter 11
    * decided against such a course - source has "source" but this makes no
        sense, so I'm keeping it corrected as gutenberg had it
    * "Why do I miss these goods things?" in source corrected to "good things?"

Chapter 12
    * revamped quotes and mdashes on "I have just got <i>The Outsider</i>"

Chapter 13

Chapter 14
    * changed "desolute" to "desolate" because I can't find the word
        "desolute"

Chapter 15

Chapter 16
    * "I punched Tom Leigh" doesn't start new paragraph in source, but
        I changed it because it starts new double-quote and seems to need to.
    * hard to tell but I believe "and Harrod's jumpy, or that the bearings"
        actually does have a comma in the source

Chapter 17

Chapter 18

Chapter 19

Chapter 20
    * not be drear and blank; that a more judicious
        is colon in source, but doesn't make sense so I changed it to semicolon
    * "Me dear boy,--" in source mdash is outside of quotes, but I
        corrected it.

Chapter 21

Chapter 22
    * "Great Scott", in source it is "Great Scot"

Chapter 23
    * changed : to ; "She mentioned the figure that would clear us; I patted
        the dog."
